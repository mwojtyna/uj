The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and highest-energy particle collider.
It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10000 
scientists and hundreds of universities and laboratories across more than 100 countries. 
It lies in a tunnel 27 kilometres (17 mi) in circumference and as deep as 175 metres (574 ft) 
beneath the France Switzerland border near Geneva.
The first collisions were achieved in 2010 at an energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam, 
about four times the previous world record. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was announced in 2012. 
Between 2013 and 2015, the LHC was shut down and upgraded; after those upgrades it reached 6.5 TeV per beam (13.0 TeV total collision energy).
